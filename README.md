Local Business Webpage

A custom webpage built for a local business using React, PHP, and CSS. The React front end delivers a smooth, responsive user experience, while PHP handles server‑side logic and any backend processing. The layout and styling are built with CSS to keep the design clean and easy to navigate.

The project is still in development as the business is currently preparing for launch. Some sections use placeholder images and temporary content until final branding, copy, and assets are provided. The focus so far has been on building the core structure and functionality, with visual refinements planned once the remaining details are confirmed.
